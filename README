Compiles on the machines in 349 Soda with "make" BUT RUNS INTO THE FOLLOWING
ERROR WHEN TRYING TO RUN EXECUTABLE "./as4":

      error while loading shared libraries: libGLEW.so.1.12: cannot open shared 
      object file: No such file or directory

As you can probabaly tell, I tried to build a separate shared GLEW library 
(the folder glew-1.12.0/) but I kept getting linker errors...If GLEW is
installed properly there should be no error.


The following libraries were used:
      - glm and Eigen were used for vector and matrix math
      - glut, freeglut, and GLEW were used to create the
        OpenGL viewing window.


After compilation, to run the animation use:
      ./as4


All of the code for initializing a window and for applying a shader borrowed
heavily from the OpenGL/GLSL tutorials at the following sites:
      - http://www.lighthouse3d.com/
      - http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/


All required features are implemented:
    -4 ball-joint links
    -different length links with longest segment greater 2 times length of smaller
    -root link attached to base by ball joint
    -arm moves over helical path in 3D, path goes through base-joint
    and out-of-reach regions
    -robust to out-of-reach goals
see video on webpage or in the folder /home/cc/cs184/sp15/class/cs184-cw/Assignments/as4/Videos
for a video of the animation.
