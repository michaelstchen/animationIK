The following libraries were used:
      - glm and Eigen were used for vector and matrix math
      - glut, freeglut, and GLEW were used to create the
        OpenGL viewing window.


After compilation ("make" on terminal), to run the animation use:
      ./as4

All of the code for initializing a window and for applying a shader borrowed
heavily from the OpenGL/GLSL tutorials at the following sites:
      - http://www.lighthouse3d.com/
      - http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/


All required features are implemented:
    -4 ball-joint links
    -different length links with longest segment greater 2 times length of smaller
    -root link attached to base by ball joint
    -arm moves over helical path in 3D, path goes through base-joint
    and out-of-reach regions
    -robust to out-of-reach goals
